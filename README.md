## **Project Abstract**

A comprehensive dataset of all the automobile crashes in New York City (NYC) from 2012 to 2024 have been collected and provided by the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focusing on identifying patterns and trends in automobile crash distributions across various boroughs of NYC, including daily and monthly trends, as well as correlations between crash frequencies in different boroughs was performed. The daily automobile crash numbers for the next two years were predicted using a time series analysis based Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The ARIMA model performed reasonably well with an average margin of error of 11.7% MAE of 69.74 crashes. The findings and methodologies presented in this work can enhance decision-making processes and aid in the development of targeted interventions to reduce traffic-related incidents in NYC and similar urban areas.
